{-| Functions which indicate how to display your `entry` type as an
accordion section.

`viewHeader` and `viewPanel` will be called with each `entry` to render
the title and body of a particular accordion section, respectively.
These functions will be passed a single `entry` and should render it
appropriately. In the simplest case, just use `Html.text` to render text only,
but you might also want to render (for example) an icon in the header or
structured paragraphs in the body.

`setExpanded` will be called to translate header clicks into `Message` values, so you can
update your model as appropriate. It receives a `Bool` indicating whether
the given `entry` is to become expanded, followed by the `entry` itself.

`getExpanded` will be called with an `entry` to determine whether it ought
to be displayed in expanded form.

{-| Render an Accordion view.

An accordion is rendered as a list of sections, each with a header and body, and each
with a notion of whether it is expanded or collapsed. When the user clicks
a given header, the accordion sends a `Message` requesting that the section
in question swap its expandedness/collapsedness.

Provide a list of `entry` values, and an `Accordion` record that indicates
how we can display an `entry` as an accordion section.

Example Usage:

    type Action
        = NoOp
        | SetExpanded Int Bool

    -- You could keep track of `expanded` in a separate data structure, if that
    -- were desirable, by supplying an appropriate `setExpanded` and
    -- `getExpanded` for the `Accordion`, and an appropriate `update` method
    type alias Entry =
        { id : Int
        , title : String
        , synopsis : String
        , expanded : Bool
        }

    sampleEntry : Entry
    sampleEntry =
        { id = 1
        , title = "Walden"
        , synopsis = "A student is bitten by a radioactive spider..."
        , expanded = True
        }
