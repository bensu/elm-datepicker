> very alpha, do not use.

Reusable datepicker elm-html based on jQuery UI Datepicker

## Develop

Run `eml-reactor` and open `localhost:8000/Main.elm`. Refresh on each
save to recompile.

To check the widget using the appropriate CSS, open `index.html` with
the browser (**not localhost**) after compiling.
